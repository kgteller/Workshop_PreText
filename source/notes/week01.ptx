    <title> 1 Background and Definitions </title>

     <p>
      In the months leading up to an election, polls often tell us the percentages of voters that prefer each of the candidates.
      How do pollsters obtain this information?
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Ideal case:</alert> ask the opinion of every registered voter.
    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Workable:</alert> contact a relatively small number of voters, and use the information from these voters to predict the preferences of the entire group of voters.
    </p>

    <p >
      The process of polling requires two major steps:
      <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <fillin characters="75" />
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        <fillin characters="75" />
      </p>
    </li>

    </ol>
<definition xml:id="def-Statistics">
  <statement>
    <p>
      <alert>Statsitics</alert> is the study of <fillin characters="75" />
    </p>
  </statement>
</definition>

<p>
  
</p>
<p>


  The polling problem is typical of a problem in statistics.
  We want some information about a large group of individuals, but we are able to collect information on only a small part of that group.
</p>

<p>
  In statistical terminology, the large group is called a <fillin characters="50" /> , 
  and the part of the group on which we collect information is called a <fillin characters="50" />
</p>

<definition xml:id="def-Population_and_Sample">
  <statement>
    <p>
      A <alert> population</alert>  is the <fillin characters="25" /> of individuals about which information is sought.
A <alert>sample </alert> is <fillin characters="25" />, containing the individuals that are actually observed.
    </p>
  </statement>
</definition>

  <title> Simple Tandom Sampling</title>
  
  \<definition xml:id="def-SRS">
    <statement>
      <p>
        A <alert>Simple Random Sample</alert> of size n is a sample chosen by a method in which <fillin characters="35" /> collection of n population items is <fillin characters="25" /> <fillin characters="25" /> to make up  the sample just as in <fillin characters="25" />
